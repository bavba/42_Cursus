# Cursus (42 Barcelona)

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the Cursus at 42 Barcelona Campus. This repository showcases my progress and contains the projects I have completed during the program.

## **Overview**

This repository serves as an ever-evolving page that reflects my growth and learning over the next two years at 42 Barcelona. It showcases the projects I have worked on, the technologies I have utilized, and the methodology I followed throughout the Cursus.

## **Projects**

**libft:** This project involves the creation of a custom library called "libft". The library contains a set of functions that replicate and extend the functionalities of common C library functions. The project aims to deepen understanding of these functions, their implementation, and their usage. The libft library will be a valuable resource for future C projects. The project includes specific requirements such as adhering to coding standards, managing memory properly, avoiding unexpected errors, and providing a Makefile for compilation. Various functions, including string manipulation and memory management, are implemented within this project.

## **Technologies and Tools**

Throughout the cursus, I utilized a variety of technologies and tools, including:

Â· Programming Languages: C. 

## **Methodology**

To ensure organization and version control, each project was developed in a separate branch and folder. Upon completion, these branches were merged with the main branch.

## **Acknowledgments**

I would like to express my gratitude to the mentors, colleagues and staff at 42 Barcelona Campus, for providing an exceptional learning environment and valuable guidance throughout the Cursus.

## **Contact Information**
